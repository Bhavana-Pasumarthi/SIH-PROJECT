Ayurvedic Traceability POC
=========================

This is a simple proof-of-concept for the Smart India Hackathon problem (botanical traceability).
It contains a backend (Node.js/Express simulated blockchain) and a frontend (React).

Run backend:
  cd backend
  npm install
  npm start

Run frontend:
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm start

Backend runs on port 4000. Frontend runs on port 3000 and expects the backend at http://localhost:4000/api
